# Shop App
This is the main project from [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/) (recommended). However, instead of using vanilla redux, I used redux-toolkit (I'm never going back) and used Typescript, because we all know that types make the world a better place ðŸ˜‰.

# Built with
* React Native (using Expo)
* Typescript
* [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
